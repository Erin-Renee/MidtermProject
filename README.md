## Travel Bored
For our midterm projects we were tasked with building a full stack app in a group. We were able to implement the skills we have learned this month using SpringMVC, JPA, as well as Java.

####Overview

 Caleb was Scrum master, he lead the standup meetings at the beginning of each day, and ensured we were all on track to meet our deadlines. Travis was the DBA. He was in charge of creating and  managing the database. Luke was in charge of solving any problems members got stuck on. Erin was the repository owner. She ensured that branches were merged, and there were not any merging conflicts.  


####Why We Chose Travel Bored
Have you ever found yourself in a new city or place, and you don't know what to do?
Don't know where to look to find events are going on, or people to go with?
Travel bored brings the travel community as well as locals together!
Users are able to host their own events, as well as remove the event that they created.
Other users can RSVP to the event, and even comment on the event!
Want to talk to other members, not related to a specific event?
We created a discussion board, where members can create their own group!
Whether you are trying to find out others opinions about restaurants in the area, or you are looking for someone else to go to an event with or a tour, you can use the discussion board as a way to chat with others!
If a member posts something inappropriate, the admin can remove that member, the event, or the comment.


####Requirements
-A fully developed database schema
-The database must be connected to your Java code using JPA
